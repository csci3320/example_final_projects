# Example final projects
This code is meant to give you ideas about what you can do with a non-linear data structure for the final project. 

Note that the example files are far shorter than your actual final project should be.

## flights.py:
Example of a non-linear data structure that is directed and has weights. It is directed because we have flights not every airport has a return flight (at least in our code). It is weighted because our flight time class keeps track of how long each flight is.

## construction.py
Example of a non-linear data structure that is directed and doesn't have weights. It is directed because you can go backwards, and it doesn't have weights because we don't need a special edge class to store weights

## campus.py
Example of a non-linear data structure that is undirected and has weights. It is undirected because each link go both ways. It is weighted because we have a custom edge class that stores walking time.

## movies.py
Example of a non-linear data structure that is undirected and doesn't have weights. It is undirected because each link go both ways. It doesn't have weights because we don't need a special edge class to store weights.
